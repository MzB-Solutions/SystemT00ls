# SManager
A **S**ystem**Manager** for CLI and GUI build on .NET 5 (previously known as .Net Core)  
The CLI app uses a customized version of [EasyConsole](https://github.com/MzB-Solutions/EasyConsole) to display menus etc.  
The GUI app uses AvaloniaUI as a presentation framework, capable of crossplatform compilation.  
This software aims to be as much an actual system tool as much as showcasing some common programming techniques and patterns.

## Build Status
We are using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to build the software, as well as running code quality and coverage checks.
